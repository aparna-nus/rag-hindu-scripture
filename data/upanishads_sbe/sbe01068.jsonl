Of these periods each succeeding one is supposed to be double the length of the preceding one. This is expressed by imagining a migration of the sun from east to south, west, north, and zenith. Each change of the sun marks a new world, and the duration of each successive world is computed as double the duration of the preceding world. Similar ideas have been more fully developed in the Purâ n as, and the commentator is at great pains to remove apparent contradictions between the Paurâ n ik and Vaidik accounts, following, as Ânanda g ñânagiri remarks, the Dravi d â k ârya (p. 173, l. 13)."}
