Essays, II, 177. Whether it is more than a coincidence, is difficult to say. Certainly we can build no other conclusions on it than those indicated by Colebrooke, that new fables may have been constructed elevating this personage to the rank of a god. We know absolutely nothing of the old K ri sh n a Devakîputra except his having been a pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa, nor does there seem to have been any attempt made by later Brahmans to connect their divine K ri sh n a, the son of Vasudeva, with the K ri sh n a Devakîputra of our Upanishad. This is all the more remarkable because the author of the Sâ n d ilya-sûtras, for instance, who is very anxious to find a s rauta authority for the worship of K ri sh n a Vâsudeva as the supreme deity, had to be satisfied with quoting such modern compilations as the Nârâya n opanishad, Atharva s iras, VI, 9, brahma n yo devakîputro, brahmanyo madhusûdana h (see Sâ n d ilya-sûtras, ed. Ballantyne, p. 36, translated by Cowell, p. 51), without venturing to refer to the K ri sh n a Devakîputra of the Khândogya-upanishad. The occurrence of such names as K ri sh n a, Vâsudeva, Madhusûdanah stamps Upanishads, like the Âtmabodha-upanishad, as modern (Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 101), and the same remark applies, as Weber has shown, to the Gopâlatâpanî-upanishad (Bibliotheca Indica, No. 183), where we actually find such names as S rîk ri sh n a Govinda, Gopî g anavallabha, Devakyâm gâtâ h (p. 38), &c. Professor Weber has treated these questions very fully, but it is not quite clear to me whether he wishes to go beyond Colebrooke and to admit more than a similarity of name between the pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa and the friend of the Gopîs."}

When he does that, then the people see again, as the poet says, the daily light of the old seed (from which the sun rises) which is lighted in heaven. The other verse belongs to a hymn addressed to the sun.
