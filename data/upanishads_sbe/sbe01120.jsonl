The difficulties, however, of p. 94 accurately translating tegas are not removed by rendering if by fire, as may be seen immediately afterward in VI, 4, 1, where te g as is said to supply the red colour of agni, the burning fire, not the god of fire. See also VI, 8, 6. In later philosophical treatises the meaning of te g as is more carefully determined than in the Upanishads."}
