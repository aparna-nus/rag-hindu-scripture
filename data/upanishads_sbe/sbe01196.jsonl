The text, tâ virâ g o bhavanti, proves nothing, because it could not be sa virâ g o bhavanti, nor even sa virâ d bhavati. Possibly the word may occur in both forms, vi g u, plural vi g ava h , and vi g ava h . In a somewhat similar way we find grîvâ and grîvâ h , folia and la feuille. On p. 109, the commentator speaks of vi g avabhâga, and again, p. 110, pakshamûlarûpâ vi g avâ abhihitâ h . He, however, explains its meaning rightly, as the root of the wings, or rather the lower bones of the neck. Grîvâ h , plural, were originally the vertebrae of the neck. The paragraph, though very empty, contains at least some interesting forms of language. First vi g u, vertebrae, then the participles duta and sambâ lh atama, and lastly the verb pratya k , the last probably used in the sense of to bring near, to represent, with the superlative adverb annatamâm (Pâ n . V, 4, 11), i. e. they are represented as if they brought the best food."}
