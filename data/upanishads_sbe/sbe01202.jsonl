III, 1, I, Introd. p. 306): 'There are three classes of men who want to acquire knowledge. The highest consists of those who have turned away from the world, whose minds are fixed on one subject and collected, and who yearn to be free at once. For these a knowledge of Brahman is intended, as taught in the Ait. Âr. II, 4-6. The middle class are those who wish to become free gradually by attaining to the world of Hira n yagarbha. For them the knowledge and worship of Prâ n a (breath and life) is intended, as explained in the Ait. Âr. II, 1-3. The lowest class consists of those who do not care either for immediate or gradual freedom, but who desire nothing but offspring, cattle, &c. For these the meditative worship of the Sa m hitâ is intended, as explained in the third Âra n yaka. They cling too strongly to the letter of the sacred text to be able to surrender it for a knowledge either of Prâ n a (life) or of Brahman.'"}
