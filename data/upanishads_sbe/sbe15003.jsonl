Death had granted three boons to Na k iketas, and no more. In a later portion, however, of the Upanishad (II, 3), the expression s ri ṅkâ vittamayî occurs, which I have translated by 'the road which leads to wealth.' As it is said that Na k iketas did not choose that s ri ṅkâ, some reader must have supposed that a s ri ṅkâ was offered him by Death. S ri ṅkâ, however, meant commonly a string or necklace, and hence arose the idea that Death must have offered a necklace as an additional gift to Na k iketas. Besides this, there was another honour done to Na k iketas by M ri tyu, namely, his allowing the sacrifice which he had taught him, to be called by his name. This also, it was supposed, ought to have been distinctly mentioned before, and hence the insertion of the three verses 16-18. They are clumsily put in, for after punar evâha, 'he said again,' verse 16 ought not to have commenced by tam abravît, 'he said to him.' They contain nothing new, for the fact that the sacrifice is to be called after Na k iketas was sufficiently indicated by verse 19, 'This, O Na k iketas, is thy fire which leads to heaven, which thou hast chosen as thy second boon.' But so anxious was the interpolator to impress upon his hearers the fact that the sacrifice should in future go by that name, that, in spite of the metre, he inserted tavaiva, 'of thee alone,' in verse 19."}
