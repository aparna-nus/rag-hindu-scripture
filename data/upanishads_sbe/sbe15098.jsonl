This is because this particular Brâhmana has passages which discuss aspects of Vedic era sex magic. To fill in the gap, I have appended a 1921 translation of the same Brâhmana. This is from the translation of Robert Ernest Hume, and includes English translations of the passages Müller left untranslated.
