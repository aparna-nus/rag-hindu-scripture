In comparing former translations, whether by Weber, Roer, Gough, and others, it will be seen that my own differs considerably from every one of them, and differs equally from S aṅkara's interpretation. It would occupy too much space to criticise former translations, nor would it seem fair, considering how long ago they were made, and how imperfect were the materials which were then accessible. All I wish my readers to understand is that, if I differ from my predecessors, I do so after having carefully examined their renderings. Unfortunately, Roer's edition of both the text and the commentary is often far from correct. Thus in the very first verse of the S vetâ s vatara-upanishad, I think we ought to read sampratish th â h , instead of sampratish th itâ h . In the commentary the reading is right. Vyavasyâm is a misprint for vyavasthâm. In the second verse we must separate kâla h and svabhâva h . Yad ri kh h â no very unusual word, meaning chance, was formerly taken for a name of the moon! Instead of na tvâtmabhâvât, both sense and metre require that we should read anâtmabhâvât, though the commentators take a different view. They say, because there is a self, and then go on to say that even that would not suffice. Such matters, however, belong to a critical commentary on the Upanishads rather than to a translation, and I can refer to them in cases of absolute necessity only, and where the readings of the two MSS., A. and B, seem to offer some help."}

The Î s vara or deva is represented as a wheel with one felly, which would seem to be the phenomenal world. It is called triv ri t, threefold, or rather having three tires, three bands or hoops to bind the felly, these tires being intended for the three gu n as of the prak ri ti, the Sattva, Ra g as, and Tamas. In the Brahmopanishad (Bibl. Ind. p. 233 p. 251) the triv ri t sûtram is mentioned. Next follows sho d a s ântam, ending in the sixteen. These sixteen are differently explained. They may be meant for the five elements and the eleven indriyas or organs (the five receptive and the five active senses, together with manas, the common sensory); or for the sixteen kalâs, mentioned in the Pra s ñ opanishad, VI, 1, p. 283. Then follows a new interpretation. The one felly may be meant for the chaos, the undeveloped state of things, and the sixteen would then be the two products in a general form, the Virâ g and the Sûtrâtman, while the remaining fourteen would be the individual products, the bhuvanas or worlds beginning with Bhû h ."}
