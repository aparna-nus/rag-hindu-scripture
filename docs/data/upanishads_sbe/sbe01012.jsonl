When the first enthusiasm for such works as S akuntalâ and Gîta-Govinda had somewhat subsided, and Sanskrit scholars had recognised that a truly scholarlike study of Indian literature must begin with the beginning, the exclusively historical interest prevailed to so large an extent that the hymns of the Veda, the Brâhma n as, and the Sûtras absorbed all interest, while the Upanishads were put aside for a time as of doubtful antiquity, and therefore of minor importance."}

It was in the year 1844, when attending Schelling's lectures at Berlin, that my attention was drawn to those ancient theosophic treatises, and I still possess my collations of the Sanskrit MSS. which had then just arrived at Berlin, the Chambers collection, and my copies of commentaries, and commentaries on commentaries, which I made at that time. Some of my translations which I left with Schelling, I have never been able to recover, though to judge from others which I still possess, the loss of them is of small consequence. Soon after leaving Berlin, when continuing my Sanskrit studies at Paris under Burnouf, I put aside the Upanishads, convinced that for a true appreciation of them it was necessary to study, first of all, the earlier periods of Vedic literature, as represented by the hymns and the Brâhma n as of the Vedas."}

Conceptions corresponding to the general teaching of the Upanishads occur in certain hymns of the Rig-veda-sa m hitâ, they must have existed therefore before that collection was finally closed. One hymn in the Sa m hitâ of the Rig-veda (I, 191) was designated by Kâtyâyana, the author of the Sarvânukrama n ikâ, as an Upanishad. Here, however, upanishad means rather a secret charm than a philosophical doctrine. Verses of the hymns have often been incorporated in the Upanishads, and among the Oupnekhats translated into Persian by Dârâ Shukoh we actually find the Purusha-sûkta, the 90th hymn of the tenth book of the Rig-veda 1 , forming the greater portion of the Bark'heh Soukt. In the Sa m hitâ of the Ya g ur-veda, however, in the Vâ g asaneyi s âkhâ, we meet with a real Upanishad, the famous Î s â or Î s âvâsya-upanishad, while the Sivasa m kalpa, too, forms part of its thirty-fourth book 2 . In the Brâhma n as several Upanishads occur, even in portions which are not classed as Âra n yakas, as, for instance, the well-known Kena or Talavakâra upanishad. The recognised place, however, for the ancient Upanishads is in the Âra n yakas, or forest-books, which, as a rule, form an appendix to the Brâhma n as, but are sometimes included also under the general name of Brâhma n a. Brâhma n a, in fact, meaning originally the sayings of Brahmans, whether in the general sense of priests, or in the more special of Brahman-priest, is a name applicable not only to the books, properly so called, but to all old prose traditions, whether contained in the Sa m hitâs, such as the Taittirîya-sa m hitâ, the Brâhma n as, the Âra n yakas, the Upanishads, and even, in certain cases, in the Sûtras. We shall see in the introduction to the Aitareya-âra n yaka, that that Âra n yaka is in the beginning"}

In the same Aitareya-âra n yaka, III, 2, 6, 6, a passage of the Upanishad is spoken of as a Brâhma n a, possibly as something like a Brâhma n a, while something very like an Upanishad occurs in the Âpastamba-sûtras, and might be quoted therefore as a Sûtra 1 . At all events the Upanishads, like the Âra n yakas, belong to what Hindu theologians call Sruti, or revealed literature, in opposition to Sm ri ti, or traditional literature, which is supposed to be founded on the former, and allowed to claim a secondary authority only; and the earliest of these philosophical treatises will always, I believe, maintain a place in the literature of the world, among the most astounding productions of the human mind in any age and in any country."}
