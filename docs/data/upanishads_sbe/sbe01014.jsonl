Though there still prevails some uncertainty as to the date of S aṅkarâ k ârya, commonly assigned to the eighth century A.D., yet I doubt whether any MSS. of the Upanishads could now be found prior to 1000 A.D. The text, therefore, which S aṅkara had before his eyes, or, it may be, his ears, commands, I think, a higher authority than that of any MSS. likely to be recovered at present."}

S aṅkara saw clearly that what had to be accounted or explained was why the king should address the Brahman first, samrâ d eva pûrvam papra k kh a; whereas if Yâ g ñavalkya had come with the intention of having a conversation with the king, he, the Brahman, should have spoken first. This irregularity is explained by the intervening sentence, in which we are reminded that on a former occasion, when G anaka and Yâ g ñavalkya had a disputation on the Agnihotra, Yâ g ñavalkya granted G anaka a boon to choose, and he chose as his boon the right of asking questions according to his pleasure. Having received that boon, G anaka was at liberty to question Yâ g ñavalkya, even though he did not like it, and hence G anaka is introduced here as the first to ask a question."}

It is not on account of the philosophical knowledge possessed by a few Kshatriyas, such as G anaka or Pravâha n a, that the privilege of government belongs everywhere to the second class. That rests on a totally different basis. Such exceptional knowledge, as is displayed by a few kings, might be an excuse for their claiming the privileges belonging to the Brahmans, but it would never, in the eyes of the ancient Indian Âryas, be considered as an argument for their claiming kingly power. Therefore, although I am well aware that pra s âs is most frequently used in the sense of ruling, I have no doubt that S aṅkara likewise was fully aware of that, and that if he nevertheless explained pra s âsana here in the sense of pra s âst ri tva m s ishyâ n âm, he did so because this meaning too was admissible, particularly here, where we may actually translate it by proclaiming, while the other meaning, that of ruling, would simply be impossible in the concatenation of ideas, which is placed before us in the Upanishad."}

I thought that possibly the commentator might have had before him the reading sa vasan, or so 'vasan, but both would be very unusual. Professor Cowell in his Various Readings, p. xii, conjectured sa m vasan, which would be liable to the same objection. He now, however, informs me that, as B. has sa m tvan, and C. satvan, he believes the original text to have been Satvan-Matsyeshu. This seems to me quite convincing, and is borne out by the reading of the Berlin MS., so far as it can be made out from Professor Weber's essay on the Upanishads, Indische Studien I, p.419. I see that Boehtlingk and Roth in their Sanskrit Dictionary, s v . satvat, suggest the same emendation."}

When therefore I was informed by my friend Dr. Bühler that he had discovered in Kashmir a MS. of the Aitareya-upanishad, I certainly expected some real help from such a treasure. The MS. is described by its discoverer in the last number of the journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, p. 34 1 , and has since been sent to me by the Indian Government. It is written on birch bark (bhûr g a), and in the alphabet commonly called S âradâ. The leaves are very much injured on the margin and it is almost impossible to handle them without some injury. In many places the bark has shrunk, probably on being moistened, and the letters have become illegible. Apart from these drawbacks, there remain the difficulties inherent in the S âradâ alphabet which, owing to its numerous combinations, is extremely difficult to read, and very trying to eyes which are growing weak. However, I collated the Upanishad from the Aitareya-âra n yaka, which turned out to be the last portion only, viz. the Sa m hitâ-upanishad (Ait. Âr. III, 1-2), or, as it is called here, Sa m hitâra n ya, and I am sorry to say my expectations have been disappointed. The MS. shows certain graphic peculiarities which Dr. Bühler has pointed out. It is particularly careful in the use of the sibilants, replacing the Visarga by sibilants, writing s + s and s + s instead of h + s and h + s ; distinguishing also the G ihvâmûlîya and Upadhmanîya. If therefore the MS. writes antastha, we may be sure that it really meant to write so, and not anta h stha, or, as it would have written, antasstha. It shows equal care in the use of the nasals, and generally carries on the sandhi between different paragraphs. Here and there I met with better readings than those given in Rajendralal Mitra's edition, but in most cases the commentary would have been sufficient to restore the right reading. A few various readings, which seemed to deserve being mentioned, will be found"}

Instead of pragayâ pa s ubhi h it writes repeatedly pra g aya pa s ubhi h , which is impossible.
