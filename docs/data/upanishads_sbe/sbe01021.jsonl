If the Sa m hitâs are presupposed by the Brâhma n as, at least in that form in which we possess them, then this Upanishad, being the only one that forms part of a Sa m hitâ, might claim a very early age. The Sa m hitâ of the White Ya g ur-veda, however, is acknowledged to be of modern origin, as compared with the Sa m hitâ of the Black Ya g ur-veda, and it would not be safe therefore to ascribe to this Upanishad a much higher antiquity than to those which have found a place in the older Brâhma n as and Âra n yakas."}

This agrees well with the position occupied by this Upanishad at the end of the Sa m hitâ, in which the sacrificial works and the hymns that are to accompany them are contained. The doctrine that the moment a man is enlightened, he becomes free, as taught in other Upanishads, led to a rejection of all discipline and a condemnation of all sacrifices, which could hardly have been tolerated in the last chapter of the Ya g ur-veda-sa m hitâ, the liturgical Veda par excellence."}
