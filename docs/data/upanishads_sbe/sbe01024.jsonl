The sun is ut, because it is high. The wind is gî, because it gives out fire, &c. (gira n ât); fire is tha, because it is the place (sthâna) of the sacrifice.

All this is very childish, and worse than childish, but it is interesting as a phase of human folly which is not restricted to the Brahmans of India. I take the following passage from an interesting article, 'On the Ogam Beithluisnin and on Scythian Letters,' by Dr. Charles Graves, Bishop of Limerick. 'An Irish antiquary,' he says, 'writing several hundred years ago, proposes to give an account of the origin of the names of the notes in the musical scale."}
