The commentator explains the first in different ways, which are all more or less fanciful. He is measured or known (mâtra) as Self, p. 89 by means of heaven as his head and the earth as his feet, these being the prâde s as; or, in the mouth and the rest, which are instruments, he is known as without action himself; or, he has the length from heaven to earth, heaven and earth being called prâde s a, because they are taught. The interpretation, supported by the G âbâla s ruti, that prâde s a is the measure from the forehead to the chin, he rejects. Abhivimâna is taken in the same meaning as abhimâna in the Vedânta, seeing everything in oneself. Vai s vânara is taken as the real Self of all beings, and, in the end, of all Selfs, and as thus to be known and worshipped."}
