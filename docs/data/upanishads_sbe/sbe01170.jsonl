S aṅkara explains vi k kh âdayanti by vidrâvayanti, and this shows that he too must have read vi k kh âyayanti, for he could not have explained vi k kh âdayanti, which means they uncover or they deprive of their clothing, by vidrâvayanti, they drive away. It is true that vi k kh âyayanti may be explained in two ways; it may be the causative of kh â, to cut, but this meaning is not very appropriate here, p. 139 and quite inadmissible in another passage where vi k kh âyayanti occurs, whereas, if derived from vi kh (ὀίχομαι) in a causative sense, S aṅkara could hardly have chosen a better explanation than vidrâvayanti, they make run away. The root vi kh , vi k kh âyayati is recognised in Pâ n ini III, 1, 28, and in the Dhâtupâ th a 28, 129, but it has hitherto been met with in this passage only, and in B ri hadâra n yaka, Up. IV, 3, 20. Here also the author speaks of a man who imagines that people kill him or do him violence, or that an elephant chases him or that he falls into a pit. Here we have hastîva vi k kh âyayati, and S aṅkara, at least as printed by Dr. Roer, explains this by vi k kh âpayati, vi k kh âdayati, vidrâvayati; dhâvatîty artha h . Much better is Dvivedaganga's commentary, as published by Dr. Weber, Satap. Brâhm. p. 1145, Kadâ k id ena m hastî vi k kh âyayatîva vidrâvayatîva; vi kh a gatau, gupûdhûpavi kh ipa n ipanibhya âya iti (Pâ n . III, 1, 28) svârtha âyapratyaya h . In the Dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth the derivation from kh â, to cut, is preferred; see Nachträge, s. v. kh â."}
