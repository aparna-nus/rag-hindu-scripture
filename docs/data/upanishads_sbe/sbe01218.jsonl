I have followed the commentator as much as possible. He says: 'If the Hot ri priest proceeds with reciting the s astra, looking to the Anush t ubh, which is speech, and not to the thousand of B ri hatîs which are breath, then, neglecting the B ri hatî (breath), and driven by his mind to the Anush t ubh (speech), he does not by his speech obtain that s astra. For in speech without breath the Hot ri cannot, through the mere wish of the mind, say the s astra, the activity of all the senses being dependent on breath.' The commentator therefore takes vâgabhi for vâ k am abhi, or for some old locative case formed by abhi. He also would seem to have read prâ n e na. One might attempt another construction, though it is very doubtful. One might translate, 'For that self, which is speech, is incomplete, because he understands if driven to the mind by breath, not (if driven) by speech.'"}
