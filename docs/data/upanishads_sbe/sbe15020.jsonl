This probably owed its origin to a difficulty felt in reconciling kriyâvân, performing acts, with the brahmavidâ m varish th a h , the best of those who know Brahman, works being utterly incompatible with a true knowledge of Brahman. Kriyâvân, however, as S aṅkara points out, may mean here simply, having performed meditation and other acts conducive to a knowledge of Brahman. Probably truthfulness, p. 39 penance, &c., mentioned in the next following verse, are the kriyâs or works intended. For grammatical reasons also this reading is preferable. But the last foot esha brahmavidâ m varish th a h is clearly defective. If we examine the commentary, we see that S aṅkara read brahmanish th a h , and that he did not read esha, which would give us the correct metre, brahmanish th o brahmavidâ m varish th a h ."}
