S aṅkara on the Taittirîyaka-upanishad p. 62 explains the human Gandharvas as men who have become Gandharvas, a kind of fairies; divine Gandharvas, as Gandharvas by birth. The Fathers or Manes are called Kiraloka, because they remain long, though not for ever, in their world. The âgâna g a Gods are explained as born in the world of the Devas through their good works (smârta), while the Karmadevas are explained as born there through their sacred works (vaidika). The Gods are the thirty-three, whose lord is Indra, and whose teacher B ri haspati. Pra g âpati is Virâ g , Brahman Hira n yagarbha. Dvivedagaṅga, in his commentary on the S atapatha-brâhma n a, explains the Fathers as those who, proceeding on the Southern path, have conquered their world, more particularly by having themselves offered in their life sacrifices to their Fathers. The Karmadevas, according to him, are those who have become Devas by sacred works ( s rauta), the Âgânadevas those who were gods before there were men. The Gods are Indra and the rest, while the Gandharvas are not explained. Pra g âpati is Virâ g , Brahman is Hira n yagarbha. Lastly, S aṅkara, in his commentary on the B ri hadâra n yakaupanishad, gives nearly the same explanation as before; only that he makes âgânadevâ h still clearer, by explaining them as gods âgânata h , i.e. utpattita h , from their birth."}
