G anaka Vaideha and Yâ g ñ avalkya are leading characters in the B ri hadâranyaka-upanishad, and whenever they meet they seem to converse quite freely, though each retains his own character, and Yâ g ñ avalkya honours G anaka as king quite as much as G anaka honours Yâ g ñ avalkya as a Brâhma n a. Now in our chapter we read that Yâ g ñ avalkya did not wish to enter on a discussion, but that G anaka was the first to address him (pûrvam papra k kh a). This was evidently considered not quite correct, and an explanation is given, that G anaka took this liberty because on a former occasion Yâ g ñ avalkya had granted him permission to address questions to him, whenever he liked. It might be objected that such an explanation looks very much like an after-thought, and we find indeed that in India itself some of the later commentators tried to avoid the difficulty by dividing the words sa mene na vadishya iti, into sam enena vadishya iti, so that we should have to translate, 'Yâ g ñ avalkya came to G anaka intending to speak with him.' (See Dvivedagaṅga's Comm. p. 1141.) This is, no doubt, a very ingenious conjecture, which might well rouse the envy of European scholars. But it is no more. The accents decide nothing, because they are changed by different writers, according to their different views of what the Pada text ought to be. What made me prefer the reading which is supported by S aṅkara and Dvivedagaṅga, though the latter alludes to the other pada k kh eda, is that the tmesis, sam enena vadishye, does not occur again, while sa mene is a common phrase. But the most interesting point, as I remarked before, is that this former disputation between G anaka and Yâ g ñ avalkya and the permission granted to the King to ask any question he liked, is not a mere invention to account for the apparent rudeness by which Yâ g ñ avalkya is forced to enter on a discussion against his will, but actually occurs in a former chapter. In S atap. Br. XI, 6, 2, 10, we read: tasmai ha Yâ g ñ avalkyo vara m dadau; sa hovâ k a, kâmapra s n a p. 162 eva me tvayi Yâ g ñ avalkyâsad iti, tato brahmâ G anaka âsa. This would show that G anaka was considered almost like a Brâhma n a, or at all events enjoyed certain privileges which were supposed to belong to the first caste only. See, for a different view, Deussen, Vedânta, p. 203; Regnaud (Matériaux pour servir à l'histoire de la philosophie de l'Inde), Errata; and Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. lxxiii."}

But others say the state of waking is indeed the same for him as sleep; there is no other intermediate place, different from this and from the other world.... And if sleep is the same as the state of waking, then is this Self not separate, not cause and effect, but mixed with them, and the Self therefore not self-illuminated. What he means p. 166 is that others, in order to disprove the self-illumination, say that this sleep is the same as the state of waking, giving as their reason that we see in sleep or in dreams exactly what we see in waking. But this is wrong, because the senses have stopped, and only when the senses have stopped does one see dreams. Therefore there is no necessity for admitting another light in sleep, but only the light inherent in the Self. This has been proved by all that went before.' Dr. Roer takes the same view in his translation, but Deussen (Vedânta, p. 205) takes an independent view, and translates: I Therefore it is said: It (sleep) is to him a place of waking only, for what he sees waking, the same he sees in sleep. Thus this spirit serves there for his own light.' Though the interpretations of S aṅkara and Dvivedagaṅga sound artificial, still Dr. Deussen's version does not remove all difficulties. If the purusha saw in sleep no more than what he had seen before in waking, then the whole argument in favour of the independent action, or the independent light of the purusha, would go; anyhow it would be no argument on Yâ g ñ avalkya's side.
