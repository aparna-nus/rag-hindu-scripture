He explains it: 'May Savit ri , taking our thoughts away from outward things, in order to concentrate them on the Highest Self, produce in our speech and in our other senses that power which can lighten all objects, which proceeds from Agni and from the other favourable deities.' He adds that 'by the favour of Savit ri , Yoga may be obtained.'"}

In the Atharva-veda XVIII, 39, if we may trust the edition, the verse begins with svâsasthe bhavatam indave na h , which is really the end of the next verse (Rv. X, 13, 2), while the second line is, vi s loka eti pathyeva sûri h s ri n vantu vi s ve am ri tâsa etat. I see no sense in pathyeva sûrâ h . S aṅkara explains pathyeva by pathi sanmârge, athavâ pathyâ kîrti h , while his later commentary, giving s ri n vantu and putrâ h sûrâtmano hira n yagarbhasya, leads one to suppose that he read sûre h s ri n vantu. S âyana (Taitt. Sa m h. IV, 1, 1, 2) explains pathyâ sûrâ iva by gîrvâ n amârga antarikshe sûryara s mayo yathâ prasaranti tadvat. The same, when commenting on the Ri g-veda (X, 13, 1), Says: pathyâ-iva sûre h , yathâ stotu h svabhûtâ pathyâ pari n âmasukhâvahâhutir vi s vân devân prati vividha m ga k kh ati tadvat. Mahîdhara (Vâ g . Sa m h. XI, 5) refers sûre h (pa n d itasya) to s loka h , and explains pathyeva by patho 'napetâ pathyâ ya g ñ amârgaprav ri ttâhuti h ."}

In fact, what was intended to be taught was this, that we must begin with sacrificial acts, then practise yoga, then reach samâdhi, perfect knowledge, and lastly bliss."}
