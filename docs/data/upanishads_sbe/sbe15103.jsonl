The Sâṅkhyas admit two principles, the Purusha, the absolute subject, and the Prak ri ti, generally translated by nature. The Vedanta philosophers admit nothing but the one absolute subject, and look upon nature as due to a power inherent in that subject. The later Sâṅkhyas therefore, who are as anxious as the Vedântins to find authoritative passages in the Veda, confirming their opinions, appeal to this and other passages, to show that their view of Prak ri ti, as an independent power, is supported by the Veda. The whole question is fully discussed in the Vedânta-sûtras I, 4, 8. Here we read rohita-k ri sh n a- s uklâm, which seems preferable to lohita-k ri sh n a-var n âm, at least from a Vedânta point of view, for the three colours, red, black, and white, are explained as signifying either the three gunas, ra g as, sattva, and tamas, or better ( Kh ând. Up. VI, 3, 1), the three elements, te g as (fire), ap (water), and anna (earth). A. reads rohita s uklak ri sh n âm; B. lohita s uklakrish n â (sic). We also find in A. and B. bhuktabhogâm for bhuktabhogyâm, but the latter seems technically the more correct reading. It would be quite wrong to imagine that a g a and a g â are meant here for he-goat and she-goat. These words, in the sense of unborn, are recognised as early as the hymns of the Ri g-veda, and they occurred in our Upanishad I, 9, where the two a g as are mentioned in the same sense as here. But there is, no doubt, a play on the words, and the poet wished to convey the second meaning of he-goat and she-goat, only not as the primary, but as the secondary intention."}

In our passage, however, akshara is referred by S aṅkara to the paramâtman, and I have translated it accordingly. Ri k a h is explained as a genitive singular, but it may also be taken as a nom. plur., and in that case both the verses of the Veda and the gods are said to reside in the Akshara, whether we take it for the Paramâtman or for the Om.

In the same manner mâyin is the maker, the artist, but also the magician or juggler. What seems intended by our verse is that from the akshara which corresponds to brahman, all proceeds, whatever exists or seems to exist, but that the actual creator or the author of all emanations is Î s a, the Lord, who, as creator, is acting through mâyâ or devâtma s akti. Possibly, however, anya, the other, may be meant for the individual purusha."}
