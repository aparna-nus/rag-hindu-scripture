These three divisions would correspond to the karmakâ n d a, yogakâ n d a, and g ñ ânakâ n d a ( G aimini, Pata ñ g ali, Bâdarâyana). See Deussen, Vedânta, p. 20. Mr. Gough and Dr. Roer take Brahmayoni as 'the source of the Veda,' or as the source of Hira n yagarbha. The irregular form vedate may be due to a corruption of vedânte."}

He reads homai h , and explains homa as the act of throwing oblations into the fire, as in the Agnihotra. This action of the hands, he thinks, stands for all actions of the various members of the body. Grâsâmbuv ri sh t i he takes to mean free distribution of food and drink, and then explains the whole sentence by 'he whose self is born unto some states or declines from them again, namely, according as he has showered food and drink, and has used his hands, eyes, feelings, and thoughts.'
