      "\n",
      "BG 5.36 states, \"With life, with heart, with mind,- nay, with the help\" (BG 5.36). This suggests that one should perform their duties with their entire being, without any attachment.\n",

      "BG 8.3 asks, \"Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is\" (BG 8.3), implying that one should understand their duties and perform them without attachment.\n",
