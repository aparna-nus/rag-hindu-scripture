The name of brâhmî-upanishad (IV, 7) can hardly be considered as a title. It means 'the teaching of Brahman,' and is used with reference to other Upanishads also 1 . S aṅkara, in his commentary, tells us that this Upanishad forms the ninth adhyâya of a Brâhma n a, or, if we take his words quite literally, he says, 'the beginning of the ninth adhyâya is \"the Upanishad beginning with the words Keneshitam, and treating of the Highest Brahman has to be taught.\"' In the eight preceeding adhyâyas, he tells us, all the sacred rites or sacrifices had been fully explained, and likewise the meditations (upâsana) on the prâ n a (vital breath) which belongs to all these sacrifices, and those meditations also which have reference to the fivefold and sevenfold Sâmans. After that followed Gâyatra-sâman and the Va m s a, the genealogical list. All this would naturally form the subject of a Sâma-veda-brâhma n a, and we find portions corresponding to the description given by S aṅkara in the Kh ândogya-upanishad, e g . the fivefold Sâman, II, 2; the sevenfold Sâman, II, 8; the Gâyatra-sâman, III, 12, I."}
