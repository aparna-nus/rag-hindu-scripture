If treated separately, what we call the fourth adhyâya of the second Âra n yaka, becomes the first adhyâya of the Upanishad, sometimes also, by counting all adhyâya from the beginning of the Aitareya-âranyaka, the ninth. The divisions adopted by Sâya n a, who explains the Upanishad as part of the Âra n yaka, and by S aṅkara, who explains it independently, vary, though Sâya n a states that he follows in his commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of S aṅkara. I have given the divisions adopted by Sâya n a, and have marked those of S aṅkara's by figures in parentheses, placed at the end of each paragraph. The difference between this Upanishad and the three preceding adhyâyas is easily perceived. Hitherto the answer to the question, Whence this world? had been, From Prâ n a, prâ n a meaning breath and life, which was looked upon for a time as a sufficient explanation of all that is. From a psychological point of view this prâ n a is the conscious self (pra g ñâtman); in a more mythological form it appears as Hira n yagarbha, 'the golden germ,' sometimes even as Indra. It is one of the chief objects of the prâ n avidyâ, or life-knowledge, to show that the living principle in us is the same as the living principle in the sun, and that by a recognition of their identity and of the true nature of prâ n a, the devotee, or he who has rightly meditated on prâ n a during his life, enters after death into the world of Hira n yagarbha."}
