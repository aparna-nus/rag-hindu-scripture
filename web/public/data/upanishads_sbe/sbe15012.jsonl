Ri ta is explained as reward, and connected with suk ri ta, lit. good deeds, but frequently used in the sense of svak ri ta, one's own good and evil deeds. The difficulty is, how the highest Brahman can be said to drink the reward ( ri tapa) of former deeds, as it is above all works and above all rewards. The commentator explains it away as a metaphorical expression, as we often speak of many, when we mean one. (Cf. Mu n d . Up. III, 1, 1.) I have joined suk ri tasya with loke, loka meaning the world, i.e. the state, the environment, which we made to ourselves by our former deeds."}
