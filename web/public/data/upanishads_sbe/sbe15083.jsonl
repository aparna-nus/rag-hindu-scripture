In the beginning this (world) was water. Water produced the true 1 , and the true is 'Brahman. Brahman produced Pra g âpati 2 , Pra g âpati the Devas (gods). The Devas adore the true (satyam) alone. This satyam consists of three syllables. One syllable is sa, another t(i), the third 3 yam. The first and last syllables are true, in the middle there is the untrue 4 . This untrue is on both sides enclosed by the true, and thus the true preponderates. The untrue does not hurt him who knows this."}
