And this is his explanation: The five Tanmâtrâs 4 (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) are called Bhûta; also the five Mahâbhûtas (gross elements) are called Bhûta. Then the aggregate 5 of all these is called s arîra, body 6 . And lastly he of whom it was said that he dwelt in the body 7 , he is called Bhûtâtmâ, the elemental Self. Thus his immortal Self 8 is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf 9 , and he himself is overcome by the qualities of nature. Then 10 , because he is thus overcome, he becomes bewildered, and because he is bewildered, he saw not the creator, the holy Lord, abiding within himself. Carried along by the waves of the qualities 11 , darkened in his imaginations, unstable, fickle,"}
